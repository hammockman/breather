# breather - ventilators for the masses

By now it must have crossed peoples's minds that (a) ventilators might be in high demand sometime soon and (b) cobbling something together to help people breathe can't be all that hard...

Supporting that optimism is this repo's intent.

1. working spec - what is a ventilator supposed to do
2. operational considerations - above all else do no harm
3. collect ideas and designs
4. match designs to available hardware and skills
5. ancillary measuring equipment - oximeter, pulse rate, ???

Righto, move on, nothing to see here. https://www.agorize.com/en/challenges/code-life-challenge
