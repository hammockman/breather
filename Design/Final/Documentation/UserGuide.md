### WARNINGS

**Untrained Personnel** Only properly trained personnel should operate the ventilator. The AgVent ventilator is a restricted medical device designed for use by Respiratory Therapists or other properly trained and qualified personnel under the direction of a physician and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

**Leak Testing the Patient Breathing Circuit** The patient circuit must be leak tested before connection to the patient. In addition, correct operation of the ventilator alarm, displays and controls should also be checked. Harm to the patient or ineffective ventilation may result from failure to leak test the patient breathing circuit before connection to a patient.

**Adjustable and Critical Alarms** For safety purposes, all adjustable alarms and all critical alarms must be checked to insure proper operation.

**Alarms Function Verification** All alarms must be verified as functioning properly on a daily basis. If any alarm malfunctions, immediately contact Manawa Ora.

**Patient Monitoring** Patients who are dependent on a ventilator should be constantly monitored by qualified personnel. Such personnel should be prepared to address equipment malfunctions and circumstances where equipment becomes inoperative. An alternative method of ventilation should be available for all patients dependent on the ventilator, and qualified personnel should be fully familiar with emergency ventilation procedures.

**Alternative Ventilation** It is recommended that an alternative means of ventilating the patient be available at all times and that all ventilator operators be fully familiar with emergency ventilation procedures.

**Fire or Explosion** Operation of the AgVent ventilator in the presence of flammable gases could cause a fire or explosion. Under no circumstances is the ventilator to be operated when explosive gases are present. The presence of nitrous oxide or flammable anesthetics presents a danger to the patient and operator.

**Patient Breathing Circuit Disconnection** Inadvertent disconnection of the patient from the patient breathing circuit can be dangerous.

<!--
**Critical Alarms**  Failure to set the critical alarms such as the Low Minute Volume alarm and the Low Pressure alarm may cause non-detection (no alarm) for a disconnection of the lower sense line or the 
exhalation valve drive line.

**Exhalation Valve Diaphragm** Patient ventilation may be ineffective or dangerous if the exhalation
valve diaphragm is damaged or worn out. The exhalation valve diaphragm must be inspected on a
daily basis and replaced whenever necessary.
Sustained HIGH PRES Alarm - During a sustained High Pressure alarm condition (HIGH PRES), the
ventilator’s turbine is stopped and gas is not delivered to the patient. Disconnect the patient from the
ventilator and ventilate the patient using an alternative method. See Chapter 15 - Troubleshooting,
Alarms for additional information concerning the HIGH PRES alarm.
BAT EMPTY Alarm - A BAT EMPTY alarm indicates the internal battery is almost depleted. Connect
the ventilator to an external power source immediately. 
Battery run time - When the battery reaches the BAT LOW level, the ventilator will only run for
approximately 10 minutes before generating a battery empty alarm (BAT EMPTY). The approximate
time shown is based on tests using the nominal settings, a new battery and a full 8 hour charge cycle
as specified in Appendix A - Ventilator Specifications. Actual run time may be more or less depending
on ventilator settings, patient demand, and battery age or condition. It is highly recommended that an
alternate power source is connected PRIOR to the ventilator reaching the BAT EMPTY alarm
condition to ensure continuous, uninterrupted patient ventilation
INOP Alarm - If an INOP alarm occurs during operation, ventilate the patient using an alternative
method, disconnect the ventilator, and immediately contact a certified CareFusion service technician
or CareFusion.
NO CAL Condition - Operation of the LTV®
 1200 / 1150 ventilator under a NO CAL condition may
result in inaccurate pressure and volume measurements. Should this condition occur, disconnect the
patient from the ventilator, provide an alternative method of ventilation and immediately contact a
certified CareFusion service technician or CareFusion.
XDCR FAULT Alarm - Continued operation of the LTV®
 1200 / 1150 ventilator with an activated
XDCR FAULT alarm may result in inaccurate flow and volume measurements. Should this condition
occur, disconnect the patient from the ventilator, provide an alternative method of ventilation and
immediately contact a certified CareFusion service technician or CareFusion.
Personal Injury and Electric Shock - Operation of the LTV®
 1200 / 1150 ventilator if any of its
panels have been removed may result in electrical shock to the patient or operator. All servicing must
be performed by a certified CareFusion service technician.
Audible Alarms - Failure to immediately identify and correct audible alarm situations may result in
serious patient injury.
Equipment Malfunction or Failure - The LTV®
 1200 / 1150 ventilator has alarms to notify operators
of certain conditions and to cease operating upon detecting possible danger. In the event of
equipment failure, all ventilator operators should have an alternative method of ventilation available
and be fully familiar with emergency ventilation procedures.
Improperly Functioning Ventilator - Operation of a ventilator that does not appear to be working
properly may be hazardous. If the ventilator is damaged, fails Ventilator Checkout tests or
malfunctions in any way, discontinue its use and immediately contact a certified CareFusion service
technician or CareFusion.
Ventilator Checkout Tests – Be aware that gas is not delivered to the patient during these tests.
Disconnect the patient from the ventilator and ventilate the patient using an alternative method before
running the Ventilator Checkout tests.
Ventilator Checkout and Maintenance Modes - The LTV®
 1200 / 1150 ventilator does not deliver
gas during the Ventilator Checkout mode (VENT CHECK) or Ventilator Maintenance mode (VENT
MTNCE) and should not be used to ventilate a patient during these tests.
Inspired Oxygen (FIO2) Concentration – If the patient has a variable respiratory rate, his/her minute
ventilation will fluctuate. If exact concentrations of inspired oxygen (FIO2) are required to be delivered
to the patient, it is recommended that an accurate oxygen analyzer with alarms be used.
O2 Cylinder Duration Information (LTV®
 1200 only) - The accuracy of the displayed useable
amount of oxygen remaining in an external O2 cylinder (O2 DUR hh:mm) is dependant on the
precision of the pressure gauge used on the O2 cylinder and the accuracy of the information provided
by the operator in the O2 CYL DUR menu settings. The calculated/displayed useable amount of
oxygen information is to be used for reference purposes only. 

Ventilation Variables and O2 Consumption - Variations in the patient’s minute ventilation, I:E ratio
and/or ventilator setting changes or equipment status (i.e. circuit leaks) affect the consumption rate of
oxygen. When warranted by a patients condition, it is recommended that a back-up cylinder or
alternative source of oxygen be available at all times.
Before Using Automobile Cigarette Lighter or Power Outlets - Before using Automobile Cigarette
Lighter or Power Outlets as a power source for the LTV®
 1200 / 1150, assure that the ventilator’s
internal battery is in good condition and fully charged. Poor cigarette lighter or power outlet
connections, electrical system defects (battery, charging system, etc.), or use of vehicle accessories
(air conditioner, high current lights, high power audio equipment, etc.) could result in less than the
required voltage being delivered to the ventilator, generate a POWER LOST alarm and switch the
ventilator’s power source to the internal battery.
Unauthorized Parts or Accessories – Serious harm to the patient may result from the use of
unauthorized parts or accessories. Only items expressly approved by CareFusion may be used in
conjunction with the LTV®
 1200 / 1150 ventilators.
Unapproved Adapters – Only CareFusion Accessories should be used to connect the ventilator to
Patient Assist Call Systems. These accessories incorporate safety features to reduce the risk of
shock. Do not attempt to modify these accessories in any way.
Patient Assist Call Connector – Do not apply more than 25V rms or 32VDC to the Patient Assist
Call connector.
Ventilator Service and Repair - All servicing or repair of the LTV®
 1200 / 1150 ventilator must be
performed only by a service technician certified by CareFusion.
Patient Circuits – CareFusion Patient Circuits, Exhalation Valve Assemblies and Water Traps are
shipped clean, not sterile.
Ultra Violet Light Sensitivity – The material used in the tubing of the Reusable Patient Circuits is
not UV stable. Avoid exposure of the tubing to UV light.
Mounting Screws - Refer to the information contained in CareFusion Replacement Screws Kit, P/N
11149, to determine the appropriate accessories mounting screws or accessories replacement
screws location, type and length to use when removing or exchanging external accessories on an
LTV®
 ventilator.
Mounting Screw Use – Internal damage to the ventilator may result if the wrong length mounting
screws are used when installing or removing external accessories.
Patient Circuit Accessories - The use of accessories such as Speaking Valves, Heat-Moisture
Exchangers and Filters create additional patient circuit resistance and in the event of a disconnection,
may impede the generation of a Low Pressure alarm. Ensure that the Low Pressure alarm settings
accommodate these types of accessories when used in combination with patient circuits.
Low Minute Volume Control Settings - The Low Min. Vol. control should be set to its highest
clinically appropriate value. If there is a clinical need to set the Low Minute Volume alarm to lower
values or off (“- - -“), perform a clinical assessment to determine if an alternative monitor (i.e. a Pulse
Oximeter with an audible alarm, or a Cardio Respiratory Monitor) should be used.
The MR Conditional LTV®
 1200 System is specified as - An LTV®
 1200 Ventilator (P/N 18888-
2XX), LTV®
 1200 MR Safe 15ft Patient Circuit (P/N 19189-001), MR Conditional Floor Stand (P/N
