# Assembly instructions

1.  Assemble pipe fittings and solenoid valves for inspiratory line as
    per MO-GA001. Take care to ensure thread tape is used on all male
    threads. Tighten fittings hand tight and then a further 3/4 turn or
    more using a spanner.

2.  Assemble pipe fittings and solenoid valve for expiratory line as per
    MO-GA001. Take care to ensure thread tape is used on all male
    threads. Tighten fittings hand tight and then a further 3/4 turn or
    more using a spanner.

3.  Lower expiratory line into housing. Mount tank fittings onto housing
    and expiratory line as per MO-GA001.

4.  Lower inspiratory line into housing. Mount Tank fittings onto
    housing and inspiratory line as per MO-GA001.

5.  Mount all sensors in T-junctions as per MO-GA001 & MO-PID-001.
    Ensure sensors are mounted using correctly modified 1" BSP blanking
    plugs.

6.  Mount 'raspberry pi controller', '12V Relay Board', '12-5V DC-DC'
    converter and '230V AC 12V DC UPS' as per MO-E-001

7.  Mount the above electrical controls into ventilator housing as per
    MO-GA001

1.  Connect solenoid valves and flow sensors to 12V Relay Board as per
    MO-E-001 & MO-PID-001

2.  Connect humidity and pressure sensors to 5V rail on Raspberry Pi
    Controller as per MO-E-002 & MO-PID-001

3.  Once device has been fully assembled. Consult MO-ITP-001 for Factory
    acceptance testing
